# Credit-Card-Transaction-Clasification

In this project the goal is to use credit card transaction data from a kaggle dataset (encrypted using PCA) to try and classify individual transactions and fraudulent
or not fraudulent. In this dataset the 2 classes are heavily unbalanced and that represents the main challenge. I try different classifiers such as an SVC, random forest, 
or K-neighbours. I then use the f1 score ot try and choose the bets one.
